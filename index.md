### Android

Android version of Sensor3D is under development. As soon as I can find some cheap real devices to test, I will try to deploy the anrdoid versions.

## Source Code
I have developed Sensor3D using Microsoft Visual Studio (I am grateful to them for the community license) 

I am planning to make this project open source in near future as soon as I finish the Android deployement.
